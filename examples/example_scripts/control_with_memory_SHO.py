# Memory-based control policy optimization (Stochastic Harmonic Oscillator)

In this more advanced example, we will optimize a symbolic control policy that is extended with a dynamic latent memory (check out this paper for more details: 
https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02765). The memory is defined by a set of differential equations, consisting of a tree for each latent unit. The memory updates every time step, and the 
control policy maps the memory to a control signal via an additional readout tree. This setup is applied to stabilization of the stochastic harmonic oscillator at random targets.

The evaluator class parallelizes the simulation of the control loop over the batched data. In each trajectory, a coupled dynamical system is simulated using diffrax, 
integrating both the dynamic memory and the dynamic environment, defined by the drift and diffusion functions. At every time step, the state of the environment is mapped to 
observations and the latent memory is mapped to a control signal. Afterwards, the state equation of the memory and environment state is computed. When the simulation is done, 
the fitness is computed given the control and environment state.
